Therefore, we introduce an approximate inference method known as sampling, which should help us get answers that are good enough. In each of the following methods, we assume that we have access to the individual probability tables of the Bayes’ Net, and we use some source of randomness (e.g., a random number generator) which simulates picking values for variables. Prior sampling is the most straightforward/baseline kind of sampling. For each variable in the BN, we use a random generator to pick a value for it (e.g., generate a float between 0 and 1 and see where it lies with respect to the distribution defined by that variable’s probability table). We repeat this a number of times we deem sufficient, and then use the numbers of samples seen to calculate the query. The last type of sampling that we talk about is Gibbs sampling. In Gibbs sampling, it allows us to take turns sampling the variable that we want to learn about. This allows us to consider both upstream and downstream variables. In likelihood weighted sampling, it only conditions on upstream variables that are being conditioned on so the weights obtained can often times be very small. Since then the sum of the weights would be small, the number of effective samples would be low as well. Gibbs works to fix this issue.\""

              "'With the right variable ordering, variable elimination can help reduce the computational and space complexity of exact inference problems by a lot.  Therefore, we introduce an approximate inference method known as sampling, which should help us get answers that are good enough. In each of the following methods, we assume that we have access to the individual probability tables of the Bayes’ Net, and we use some source of randomness (e.g., a random number generator) which simulates picking values for variables. Prior sampling is the most straightforward/baseline kind of sampling. For each variable in the BN, we use a random generator to pick a value for it (e.g., generate a float between 0 and 1 and see where it lies with respect to the distribution defined by that variable’s probability table). We repeat this a number of times we deem sufficient, and then use the numbers of samples seen to calculate the query. The last type of sampling that we talk about is Gibbs sampling. In Gibbs sampling, it allows us to take turns sampling the variable that we want to learn about. This allows us to consider both upstream and downstream variables. In likelihood weighted sampling, it only conditions on upstream variables that are being conditioned on so the weights obtained can often times be very small. Since then the sum of the weights would be small, the number of effective samples would be low as well. Gibbs works to fix this issue.'"

        "- There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n",
        "- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n",
        "- In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.\n",
        "- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
        "- \"Scaled\" attention additional divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below"

The Champions League final, the annual pinnacle of the European club season, will take place on June 10th in Istanbul. This year, it features an exciting showdown between two formidable teams: Italian giants Inter Milan and English juggernaut Manchester City. As anticipation builds, football enthusiasts eagerly await to witness whether the coveted trophy will head to Milan or Manchester. Inter Milan's remarkable journey to the final surprised many observers. Drawn into the formidable group of death alongside powerhouses Bayern Munich and Barcelona, Inter defied expectations. They secured a spot in the knockout stages by finishing ahead of Barcelona with a crucial draw at the Nou Camp on Matchday 5. Inter's solid defensive performances propelled them through the rounds, triumphing over Porto and Benfica without conceding a single goal. In the semi-finals, they faced their fierce rivals, AC Milan, and emerged victorious with a resounding 3-0 win, sealing their ticket to Istanbul.\""

The last time an Italian team lifted the Champions League trophy was in 2010 when Jose Mourinho's Inter defeated Bayern Munich. Juventus, among other Italian clubs, have come close to glory but fell short. The significance of Inter's achievement resonates deeply within Italian football, raising hopes for a resurgence on the European stage. European Football Broadcaster Mina Rzouki told us, It is hugely important that Serie A is recognised again as a league that is trying to innovate and trying to move forward, and getting back to that top level of European football. There are still some cliches about Italian teams, that they are all still very defensive and play tactical football, when in fact, they are a lot of fun. Serie A has outscored the Premier League on multiple occasions over the last few years. Unfortunately, we rarely see this in the Champions League because Italian football is short of funding and when they are pitted directly against these European giants, they often do not have enough to overcome them.\""

They comfortably won their group, which included Borussia Dortmund, Sevilla, and Copenhagen, with a game to spare. In the round of 16, City dominated German side Red Bull Leipzig, scoring seven goals across two legs. Their quarter-final clash against Pep Guardiola's former team, Bayern Munich, saw them emerge triumphant with a convincing 3-0 victory at home. In the semi-finals, they faced Real Madrid in a rematch of the previous year's encounter, and City's dominant second-leg performance resulted in a resounding 5-1 aggregate victory.\"\n",

Under Pep Guardiola's tenure, the club has come agonizingly close on multiple occasions, including a loss to Premier League rivals Chelsea in the 2021 final. Since their rise to prominence in 2008, the European Cup has remained the elusive trophy missing from their cabinet. As they vie for the title, football enthusiasts ponder the key ingredients needed for City to finally cross the finish line in this prestigious competition. I think, for them, it is almost more psychological at this point. They seem have had a mental block,” explained Semra Hunter, Broadcaster for La Liga. Guardiola is a great manager but I think a lot of it has to do with him rather than the players. He has been known to ‘overthink’ big games, because there has been a lot of pressure on him to win this competition since he left Barcelona. To go 12 years without lifting this trophy is surprising. Istanbul's Ataturk Stadium, the venue for this year's final, evokes memories of a historic showdown from 2005. On that occasion, AC Milan, Inter's city rivals, faced Liverpool in an unforgettable clash. With the prospect of a thrilling encounter reminiscent of the dramatic events of the past, football enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the final in Istanbul, hoping for a similarly captivating spectacle. The stage is set for an epic battle as Manchester City and Inter Milan prepare to face off in the Champions League final. Will Manchester City finally clinch their first European Cup, or will Inter Milan add another trophy to their illustrious history?\""
